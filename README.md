**Clawd-on-desk-insights automatically scans the conversations you've already had with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor and other agents, and turns them into a timeline plus AI-generated session summaries.** No more scrolling through endless chat history — it builds the knowledge cards for you.

Every conversation leaves an **imprint**. No idea you tried, no bug you wrestled with, no decision you made together with the Agent is ever wasted — they all come back into view in the **Analytics Dashboard**.

All data stays on your machine. AI analysis runs through your own local `claude` / `codex` CLI (or an API / Ollama backend you configure). Your conversations never touch a third party.

> Supports Windows 11, macOS, and Linux (tested on Ubuntu). Requires Node.js.

## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yx0716/clawd-on-desk-insights.git
cd clawd-on-desk-insights
npm install
npm start
```

A small crab appears on your desktop — right-click it to open the **Analytics Dashboard**. For provider setup and analysis workflows, see [Getting Started](#getting-started) below.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yx0716/clawd-on-desk-insights.git
cd clawd-on-desk-insights
npm install
npm start
```

Once it launches, a small crab (the default theme) appears on your desktop — that's the Clawd pet, and **every entry point to the dashboard goes through it**.

### 2. Open the Analytics Dashboard

There are three ways to open it — pick whichever feels natural:

- **Right-click the desktop pet** → choose **Analytics Dashboard** from the context menu
- **Click the tray icon** (menu bar on macOS, system tray on Windows/Linux) → **Analytics Dashboard**
- **Keyboard shortcut**: macOS `⌘ + Shift + Option + A`  |  Windows / Linux `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + A`

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-dashboard-menu.gif" width="720" alt="Right-click menu showing Analytics Dashboard">
</p>

The first time you open it, you'll see your timeline immediately — it just reads the session logs already on your disk. **No setup required for that part.**

### 3. Configure an AI Provider for session summaries

The timeline works out of the box. But to make the dashboard automatically **generate a recap summary for each session**, you need to point it at something that can call a large language model — an **AI Provider** (the analysis backend). There are three options:

| Provider type | What it is | Setup | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local CLI** *(recommended)* | Reuses the `claude` (Claude Code) or `codex` CLI you already have installed. Uses your existing subscription, no extra API charges. | **Nothing — auto-detected** | Anyone already using Claude Code or Codex — zero overhead |
| **API key** | An API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, or another provider. Pay-per-token. | Paste your key into the dashboard settings | Users without a local CLI who don't mind a small token cost |
| **Ollama** | A locally-hosted open model server (e.g. Ollama). | Point the dashboard at your Ollama endpoint | Fully offline, never sends data to the cloud |

> **💡 Strong recommendation**: if you already have Claude Code or Codex CLI installed, **do nothing** — the dashboard auto-detects them and reuses your existing subscription quota. Cheapest and easiest path.

If you don't want to configure a provider right now, click **Skip** on the startup screen. You can always set it up later in the settings.

</p>

### 4. Where to configure / change the provider later

If you skipped step 3, or you want to switch providers later, you can adjust it via **AI Provider Settings** at any time:

Open the Analytics Dashboard → click the **gear icon ⚙** in the top-right → **AI Provider Settings** dialog appears.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-ai-provider-settings.gif" width="720" alt="AI Provider Settings dialog">
</p>

The dialog has two sections:

- **LOCAL CLI DETECTION** — shows whether the dashboard found `claude` and `codex` on your machine. Green dot = found (with version + path); red dot = missing. **If you see green dots, everything is working — proceed to the next step.**
- **API PROVIDER (FALLBACK)** — if no local CLI is installed, you can use an API key for AI session analysis (Claude / OpenAI / Ollama / …) — just paste the key and you're set.

> **Tip**: if your `claude` or `codex` was installed via **NVM, fnm, or Volta**, auto-detection may miss it. Run `which claude` or `which codex` in your terminal and paste the output into the **Claude binary path** / **Codex binary path** override field.

### 5. Start AI session analysis

#### Method A: Batch pre-analysis (auto-prompted on dashboard open)

Every time you open the Analytics Dashboard, if there are unanalyzed sessions, the dashboard **automatically pops up a dialog** — `Pre-analyze Sessions` — letting you analyze a whole time range in one go.

> **Note**: the dashboard's own internal AI summary jobs are automatically excluded from the timeline and session stats. Even if you launch `npm start` from some other directory, those internal analysis runs will not be counted as work sessions.

Available scopes:

- **Today** — every session from today
- **3 Days** — the last 3 days
- **Week** — the last 7 days
- **Custom** — your last N sessions

Pick a scope, hit confirm, and the dashboard runs through them in the background, showing an `Analyzing 1/N`, `2/N`, ... progress bar. **Already-analyzed sessions are auto-skipped** (per-provider cache), so re-clicking never wastes tokens.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screen-shot-select-AI-provider.gif" width="720" alt="Batch pre-analysis and per-session analysis in action">
</p>

> **Best for**: first-time users, monthly retrospectives, catching up on a backlog.

#### Method B: Click a single session (from the timeline or the sessions list)

If you **only want to review one specific session**, no batch needed, just click it:

- **From the timeline** — in Timeline view, click any colored block (each block is a session) and the detail card slides out on the right
- **From the Sessions list** — click any session card in the right-side list

Either way, the dashboard will:

1. Show the **cached summary first** if it exists (sessions previously batch-analyzed are tagged `Analyzed` and open instantly)
2. If not yet analyzed, the click **immediately kicks off a single-session analysis** — the card shows an `Analyzing…` tag, and the result appears in seconds to tens of seconds

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-ai-analysis.gif" width="720" alt="Triggering single-session analysis from the timeline">
</p>

> **Best for**: you already know which session you want to revisit, ad-hoc lookups, day-to-day "scrolling through" history.

**In summary:**

- **First time using it** → run **Method A on Week** once, or pick a custom range/count for the sessions you want analyzed. Takes a few minutes and costs more tokens upfront, but every record opens instantly afterwards.
- **Daily use** → after that initial batch, switch to **Method B — pick specific sessions** as needed. Only fresh ones require a manual trigger.
- **Token-sensitive** → use **Method B on demand**. Only analyze the sessions you actually want to read — zero wasted tokens.

> **About cost**: Local CLI (Claude Code / Codex subscription) analysis **uses your existing subscription quota** — typically no extra charges. In API key mode, the dashboard shows **token usage and cost** in the top status bar after each analysis completes, so you always know what you're spending.

## How it works

Clawd runs two independent data paths side by side:

```
Your Agent                              Clawd
  │                                      │
  ├── live events ──→ hook / poll / plugin ──→ 🦀 pet animation
  │                                      │
  └── chat history ──→ local JSONL files ────→ 📊 insights dashboard
```

### Path ①: Live awareness → pet animation

While an agent works (calling tools, waiting for input, erroring out, finishing a task…) it emits events. Clawd captures them through three integration modes and drives the pet accordingly:

| Mode | How it works | Latency | Agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Command hook** | Agent fires an event → automatically runs a script → script HTTP-POSTs the event to Clawd's local server (`127.0.0.1:23333`) | Near zero | Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor Agent, Kiro CLI |
| **Log polling** | Clawd scans the agent's JSONL log file every ~1.5 s and detects new entries | ~1.5 s | Codex CLI, Gemini CLI (fallback) |
| **In-process plugin** | Plugin runs inside the agent's own runtime, forwarding events with zero overhead | Zero | opencode |

All events map to the same state machine: `idle → thinking → working → happy / error → sleeping`. The pet plays the matching SVG animation. When multiple sessions run simultaneously, it auto-switches to juggling / building / conducting animations.

> **Multi-agent coexistence**: Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, Kiro, and opencode can all run at the same time. Clawd tracks each session independently and displays the highest-priority state.

### Path ②: Offline analysis → insights dashboard

Every conversation you have with an agent is saved as JSONL on your disk:

| Agent | Local history path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/` |
| Cursor Agent | `~/.cursor/projects/` |

The insights dashboard reads these files directly to generate timelines and AI summaries. **It doesn't go through hooks and doesn't require the pet to be running** — as long as chat history exists on disk, the dashboard works.

> **Note**: the analytics scanner currently covers only the three agents above. Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Kiro CLI, and opencode still drive pet animations, but their local histories are not yet wired into the dashboard scanner.

## FAQ

**Q: Does the dashboard need internet?**
Scanning and the timeline are **fully offline**. Whether AI summaries need internet depends on which provider you pick: Local CLI uses whatever network stack Claude Code / Codex normally use; Ollama is fully offline; API key mode talks to the cloud.

**Q: Are my conversations uploaded anywhere?**
No. Clawd Insights collects zero telemetry. The provider step is *your* CLI or *your* API key calling *the model you chose* directly — no third-party server in the middle.

**Q: I don't have Claude Code or Codex. Can I still use it?**
Yes. You can use the timeline view alone (completely free, no LLM required), or paste an Anthropic / OpenAI API key into AI Provider Settings to enable the cloud path.

## About the Fork

This is a fork of [`rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk`](https://github.com/rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk) — a desktop pet that reacts to your coding agent in real time. The pet is still here (animations, permission bubbles, multi-agent state tracking), but the focus of *this* fork is the insights layer on top.

Multi-agent support carried over from upstream: **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, **Copilot CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, **Cursor Agent**, **Kiro CLI**, and **opencode**. Note that the analytics scanner currently covers Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Cursor Agent only — the other agents still drive pet animations, but their histories aren't yet wired into the dashboard.

For the full feature list of the desktop pet (animations, permission bubbles, mini mode, click reactions, themes, remote SSH, etc.), see the [upstream README](https://github.com/rullerzhou-afk/clawd-on-desk).
